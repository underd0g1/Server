#Samba Server Instructions

Install Samba 
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install samba

Set a password for your user in Samba 
$ sudo smbpasswd -a <user_name>

Note: 
`
Samba uses a separate set of passwords than the standard Linux system accounts (stored in /etc/samba/smbpasswd), so you'll need to create a Samba password for yourself. This tutorial implies that you will use your own user and it does not cover situations involving other users passwords, groups, etc...
Tip1: Use the password for your own user to facilitate.
Tip2: Remember that your user must have permission to write and edit the folder you want to share.
Eg.:
 $ sudo chown <user_name> /var/opt/blah/blahblah
 $ sudo chown :<user_name> /var/opt/blah/blahblah
Tip3: If you're using another user than your own, it needs to exist in your system beforehand, you can create it without a shell access using the following command :
 $ sudo useradd USERNAME --shell /bin/false

You can also hide the user on the login screen by adjusting lightdm's configuration, in /etc/lightdm/users.conf add the newly 
`
created user to the line :
hidden-users=
Create a directory to be shared 
$ mkdir /home/<user_name>/<folder_name>

Make a safe backup copy of the original smb.conf file to your home folder, in case you make an error 
$ sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf ~

Edit the file "/etc/samba/smb.conf" 
$ sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

Once "smb.conf" has loaded, add this to the very end of the file using your favorite text editor:
`
[<folder_name>]
path = /home/<user_name>/<folder_name>
valid users = <user_name>
read only = no
`

Restart the samba: 
$ sudo service smbd restart

Once Samba has restarted, use this command to check your smb.conf for any syntax errors 
$ testparm
      
To access your network share 
      $ sudo apt-get install smbclient
      # List all shares:
      $ smbclient -L //<HOST_IP_OR_NAME>/<folder_name> -U <user>
      # connect:
      $ smbclient //<HOST_IP_OR_NAME>/<folder_name> -U <user>

# Access 
linux:
`
smb://<HOST_IP_OR_NAME>/<folder_name>/
or 
\\<HOST_IP_OR_NAME>\<folder_name>\ 
`
Windows: 
` 
map network drive
add new drive
smb://<HOST_IP_OR_NAME>/<folder_name>/
default: Workgroup
`
Mac:
`
navigate to "go"
connect to server
$ smb://<HOST_IP_OR_NAME>/<folder_name>/
`
